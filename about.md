I'm a Neuroscience PhD candidate at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.  I create large scale computer algorithms to map and simulate the neural networks in the brain. My fields of specialization are Parallel and Distributed Computing, Simulation, Optimization and Machine Learning. Prior to this, I graduated with a MSc Advanced Computing from the Imperial College London, with distinction for my research project, and I worked in London, Sao Paulo, New York and Slovenia. I like to ski, read, travel, and I play for the Lausanne City waterpolo team in the National League B. I'm now looking for my next professional experience and would be happy to hear from you.  If you'd like to learn more about me you can read my <a href="cv.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=pirWLLgAAAAJ">publications</a>, or send me an <a href="mailto:bruno@magalhaes.pro?subject=Hello">email</a>. Thanks for visiting my page!
