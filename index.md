<p class="lead"><b>Researcher for High Performance Computing and Machine Learning</b></p>

I'm an AI resident at [Microsoft Research]({{ site.microsoft_cambridge_url }}) in Cambridge (UK), working on probabilistic machine learning, time-sequence data and graph neural networks. Prior to this, I completed a PhD Computational Neuroscience at EPFL in Switzerland --- researching large-scale reconstruction and simulation of brain-inspired neural networks --- and worked as a research software engineer for distributed algorithms. My fields of specialization are Parallel and Distributed Computing, Machine Learning and Simulation. To know more about me, read my [resume]({{ site.resume}}), [publications]({{ site.google_scholar }}), or [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hello).
