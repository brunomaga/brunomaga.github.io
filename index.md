I'm a Machine Learning research engineer with a large expertise on High Performance Computing, i.e. large-scale data science, distributed storage, data processing, multicore/GPU algorithms implemented on several supercomputers with over 10K nodes and exabyte scale datasets.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was an AI resident at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge">Microsoft Research</a> in Cambridge (UK), working on probabilistic machine learning, time-sequence data and graph neural networks. Prior to this, I completed a PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> in Switzerland (researching large-scale reconstruction and simulation of brain-inspired spiking neural networks) and worked as a research software engineer for distributed algorithms at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/">Blue Brain Project</a>. 
</p>

<p>
My research interests are Machine Learning applied to chaotic and massively-large datasets and compute infrastructure, and all related questions that can arise from the field, such as data confidentiality, poisoning attacks, learning from population clusters, learning from networks, federated ML, parallel ML processing, etc.

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Research Interests</h4>

I'm interested in applying Machine Learning to solve big engineering problems. When such ML systems don't exist, I like to create them, or at least face the challenge of trying. There are two big questions that I faced in life and would like to solve at some point, for the benefit of all:
- How to scale the processing of machine learning systems ([Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)) to adapt to the exponential growth of new-generation data such as bots, generative ML, etc? For this I tend to read about decentralized and federated ML;
- How to make artificial neurons learn like spiking neurons, i.e. without back-propagation, loss function, and iterations?

         We improved the load balancing of the CPU (and later storage) of thousands of Exchange email servers, dictated by the usage of individual email users across daytime, location, and logging information with over 2 exabytes of information. We provided a better mapping of user-to-CPU and a better answer to the question "which user should be allocated to each server at a given interval" by learning time series from user usage patterns. We implemented several algorithms to efficiently handle and do feature extraction on such distributed dataset. We later used Deep Neural Nets, Recursive Neural Nets, GRUs Encoder-Decoder with Attention Mechanism, and Bayesian Optimization (closed-form, Variational Inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to learn from the data;

         We also built a recommendation system on a distributed graph with over a trillion edges, mapping all Meetings, Documents, Users and Emails. We developed several techniques to efficiently traverse the graph and filter the subgraph that would best relate to the query of similarity for two given nodes. This similarity metric would be learnt using a Graph Neural Net and Deep Neural Nets and the target would allow similar nodes to be recommended when creating meetings or emails;

When time allows, I post about HPC or ML projects I was involved in, or publications and discussions I find interesting.

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Misc</h4>

I have been playing waterpolo for most of my life, the last 10 years with [Lausanne Waterpolo](https://lausannenatation.ch/section/waterpolo/) and [Cambridge City Waterpolo](https://www.cambridgewaterpolo.co.uk/) clubs. I am also a big fan of winter sports, particularly skiing and snowboarding, and I feel lucky to live close to many great ski resorts in Switzerland. I also enjoy cooking and hope one day my cooking skills reach very high standards.

As a general rule, I prefer not to be addressed by my academic title or surname (e.g. *"Dear Dr Bruno"* or *"Dear Mr Magalhaes"*). I believe education is about knowledge and not diplomas. So addressing me simply by my first name (*"Hi Bruno"*) is perfectly fine :)
