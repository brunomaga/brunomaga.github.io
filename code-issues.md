# Code and data issues

Bugs in the code and data files of the posts (under `assets/`), found by the text rewrite. Each item names the file,
the problem and a proposed fix.

## Distributed Sorting Algorithms (2014-06-21-distributed-sort.md)

- `assets/distributed-sort/distributedmemorysorter.cxx`, `oddEvenSort_MPI`: the loop runs exactly `mpiSize` phases,
  which sorts the data only when every rank holds the same number of elements. Its own test, `test_OddEvenSort`,
  gives rank r `1000000 + 3r` elements. A simulation with unequal counts fails to sort in about a third of the
  cases after p phases. Fix: balance the counts first, or run phases until an even and an odd phase in a row change
  nothing (an all-reduce of a "changed" flag per phase).

## Distributed Load Balancing and Spatial Slicing (2015-12-01-slicing.md)

- `assets/slicing/slicing.tar.gz`, `DistributedLoadBalancing.cxx` line 20 and `DistributedSorting.cxx` line 28: the
  checksum test is inverted. It warns "checksum ... failed" when the sums before and after are equal
  (`std::abs(pre_sum - post_sum) < 0.000001`), and stays silent when they differ. The warnings are off by default
  (`outputWarnings = false`). Fix: warn when the difference is larger than a relative tolerance, e.g.
  `std::abs(pre_sum - post_sum) > 1e-9 * std::abs(pre_sum)`, since the sum of many doubles changes with the order
  of the additions.

## Unsupervised Learning basics and Principal Component Analysis (2017-11-01-unsupervised-learning.md)

- `assets/unsupervised-learning/kohonen_mnist.zip`, `kohonen.py`, `name2digits`: the function loads `hash.mat`,
  which is not in the zip, so the script stops with a `FileNotFoundError` before the training starts. Fix: add
  `hash.mat` to the zip, or set the digits directly, e.g. `targetdigits = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, the digits of the post's
  figure.

## Bayesian Linear Regression, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum-A-Posteriori (2018-08-20-bayesian-linear-regression.md)

- `assets/bayesian-linear-regression/bayesian_linear_regression.ipynb`, predictive distribution cell: the data
  have a noise standard deviation of 0.25 (`create_toy_data(sinusoidal, 25, 0.25)`), but the model uses
  `BayesianRegression(alpha=1e-3, beta=2.)`, i.e. a noise standard deviation of 0.71. The predictive band is thus
  three times too wide. Fix: `beta=16.` (1 / 0.25^2).
- Same notebook, posterior cell: `plt.contour(w0, w1, multivariate_normal.pdf(...))` uses the default levels, and
  draws the contour at density 0 where the pdf underflows. Fix: pass
  `levels=pdf.max() * np.exp(-0.5 * np.array([9, 4, 1]))`, or draw the contours of the log-density.
- Same notebook, `GaussianFeature` docstring: "exp(-0.5 * (x - m) / v)" misses the square that the code applies.
  Fix: "exp(-0.5 * (x - m)^2 / v)". `predict(..., sample_size)` says it samples "from the predictive
  distribution", but it returns the noise-free lines `X @ w` for weights drawn from the posterior. Fix: "samples of
  the mean function X @ w, with w drawn from the posterior".
