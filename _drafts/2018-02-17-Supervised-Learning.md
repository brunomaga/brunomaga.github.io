Supervised Learning is the field of machine learning that learns through supervision, or in practice, learns with the help of an external agent (human or automatic) that provides the solution for a given training set, in order to *provide an approximator* for the mechanics that relates the given input to the outputs (labels). We present the basic contents in the following sections. Advanced topics will be covered in individual posts.

## Regression

Regression relates an input variable to an output, to either predict new outputs, or understand the effect of the input in the output. A regression dataset consists of a set of pairs $(x_n, y_n)$ of size $N$ with input $x_n$ and output/label $y_n$. For a new input $x_n$, the goal of regression is to find $f$ such that $$ y_n \approx f(x_n) $$. It does so by finding **weights** $w$ that approximate:
- linear regression: $$ y_n \approx f(x_n) = w_0 + w_1 x_{n1} $$
- multilinear regression: $$ y_n \approx f(x_n) = w_0 + w_1 x_{n1} + ... + + w_D x_{nD} $$
- logistic regression: $$ y_n \approx f(x_n) = \frac{e^{x_n}}{1+e^{x_n}} = \frac{1}{1+ e^{-x_n}} $$ 

If $$ D \gt N $$ is called the problem is [under-determined]().

## Convexity

A function is **convex** if a line joining two points never intersects with the function anywhere else, ie:

$$
f (\lambda u + (1-\lambda) v) \le \lambda f(u) + (1-\lambda)f(v)
$$

 A convex function has only one global minimum value. A strictly convex function has a unique global minimum, ie the inequality $\le$ is strict ($\lt$). Sums of convex functions are also convex. An alternative definition of convexity (*for differentiable functions*) is that the function must always lie above its [linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearization), i.e.

$$
L(u) \ge L(w) + \triangledown L(w)^T (u-w) \text{, for all } u,w
$$

A set $C$ is convex the line segment between any two points of $C$ lies in $C$, i'e does not touch outside the limits of $C$. Here's a picture of a convex and a non-convex set:

Intersections of convex sets are convex. 

## Loss

The quality of the approximation is provided by the **loss** or **cost function**. Examples:
- Mean Square Error: $$ MSE(w) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N [ y_n - f(x_n)]^2 $$ , large errors have relatively greater influence, so it is not good for outliers;
- Mean Absolute Error: $$ MAE(w) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \mid y_n - f(x_n) \mid $$ 
- Huber: $$ Huber(w) = 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2}e^2 & \text{, if } \mid e \mid \le \delta\\
    \delta \mid e \mid - \frac{1}{2}\delta^2 & \text{, if } \mid e \mid \gt \delta
\end{cases}
$$
  - convex, differentiable, and also robust to outliers. The hard bit is to set $\delta$
- Tukey’s bisquare loss (defined in terms of the gradient): $$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial e} =
\begin{cases}
    e (1-\frac{e^2}{\delta^2})^2 & \text{, if } \mid e \mid \le \delta\\
    0 & \text{, if } \mid e \mid \gt \delta\\
\end{cases}
$$
  - non-convex, but robust to outliers;

For personal amusement, in this [website](https://lossfunctions.tumblr.com/) we find a funny compilation of loss functions gone *wrong*.

## Optimization

Given a cost function $L(w)$ we want to find the weights that mimimizes the cost, via:
- Grid Search (brute-force);
- Least Squares: analytical solution for regression with MSE loss function: 
  - take the simplest form of linear regression with $y = Xw$. We want to minimize the MSE loss function i.e. minimize
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    & (y - Xw)^2 \\
  = & (y-Xw)^T(y-Xw) \\
  = & y^Ty - y^TXw - (Xw)^Ty + (Xw)^TXw \\
  = & y^Ty - w^TX^Ty - w^TX^Ty + w^TX^TXw \\
  = & y^Ty - 2 w^TX^Ty + w^TX^TXw;\\
  \end{align*}
  $$
  - **If $X^TX$ is invertible**, this minimization problem has an unique closed-form solution. To find the minimal value, we set the derivative to zero and this leads us to:\\
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    & \frac{\partial}{\partial w} y^Ty - 2 w^TX^Ty + w^TX^TXw = 0 \\
  \Leftrightarrow & 0 - 2 X^Ty + 2 X^TXw = 0 \\
  \Leftrightarrow & 2 X^TXw = 2X^Ty \\
  \Leftrightarrow & w = (X^TX)^{-1} X^Ty;\\
  \end{align*}
  $$
    - In the previous computation, note that $\frac{\partial w^Ta}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial a^Tw}{\partial w} = a$ (<a href="{{ site.assets }}/the_matrix_cookbook.pdf">The Matrix Cookbook</a>, eq 2.4.1).
  - As a side note, the **Gram matrix $X^TX$** is invertible if **X has full column rank***, i.e. $rank(X)=D$ (we'll ommit the proof). The rank of a matrix is defined as (a) the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors in the matrix, therefore we we assume that all columns are linearly independent; 

- Gradient Descent: $$ w^{t+1} = w^{t} - \gamma \triangledown L (w^t) $$, for step size $\gamma$, and gradient $$ \triangledown L (w) = [ \frac{\partial L(w)}{\partial w_1}, ... , \frac{\partial L(w)}{\partial w_D}  ]^T $$;
- Stochastic Gradient Descent: $$ w^{t+1} = w^{t} - \gamma \triangledown L_n (w^t) $$, for a random choice of an inputs $n$. Computationally cheap but unbiased estimate of gradient;
- Mini-batch SGD: $$ w^{t+1} = w^{t} - \gamma \frac{1}{\mid B \mid} \sum_{n \in B} \triangledown L_n (w^t) $$, for a random subset $ B \subseteq [N] $. For each sample $n$ , we compute the gradient at the same current point $w^{(t)}$;

With some variants:
- Subgradient Descent: $$ w^{t+1} = w^{t} - \gamma g $$, where $g$ is a [subgradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative#The_subgradient) of $L$ (useful when function is not differentiable at $w^{(t)}$; 
- Projected Gradient: useful to solve a constrained optimization problem $min_w L(w)$ subject to $w \in C$, where $C \subset R^D$ is the constraint set;
  - projected gradient descent minimizes a function subject to a constraint. At each step we move in the direction of the negative gradient, and then "project" onto the feasible set.
  - Projections onto convex sets are unique;
  - Definition of projection: $$ P_c(w') = argmin_{v \in C} \| v - w' \| $$;
  - Update rule: $$ w^{(t+1)} = P_C [ w^{(t)} - \gamma \triangledown L (w^{(t)}) ] $$
  - alternatively, one can use penalty functions instead of projections, solving $$ min_{w \in R^D} L(w) + I_c(w) $$ where $I_c$ is the penalty function;

When $$ \triangledown L (w) $$ is close to zero, we are close to an optimum. If second derivative is positive (semi-definite), then it may be a local minimum. If the function is convex, we are at a global minimum. 

Gradient descent is very sensitive to ill-conditioning. Normalizing input dimensions allows the step size to properly adjust to high differences in features dimensionalities. Choosing step size can be tricky. See [MIT_252_Lecture04.pdf](/assets/Supervised-Learning/MIT_252_Lecture04.pdf) and [optpart2.pdf](/assets/Supervised-Learning/optpart2.pdf) for some guidance, and the famous **Armijos Rule**.

Gradient descent is a first-order method (only looks at the gradient).  We get a more powerful optimization algorithm if we use also the second order terms. We need fewer steps to converge if we use second order terms, on the other hand every iteration is more costly. The **Newton's method** make use of the second order terms and takes steps in the direction that minimizes a quadratic approximation. We define the **Hessian** as 

$$
H_{i,j} = \frac{\partial^2 L(w)}{\partial w_{i} \partial w_j} 
$$  

and the update function of Newton's method as:

$$
w^{(t+1)} = w^{(t)} - \gamma ^{(t)} ( H^{(t)})^{-1} \triangledown L(w^{(t)}).
$$

[comment]: <>  This term comes from the second order Taylor approximation of a function around a point $$ w^{\star} $$:
[comment]: <> 
[comment]: <> $$
[comment]: <> L(w) \approx L(w^{\star}) + \triangledown L(w^{\star})^T (w - w^{\star}) + \frac{1}{2}(w - w^{\star})^T H(w^{\star})(w - w^{\star}).
[comment]: <> $$ 

I'll ommit the explanation of this formula, but email me if you are interested. As an important remark, this method is not commonly used. Although it can be faster when the second derivative is known and easy to compute, the analytic expression for the second derivative is often complicated or intractable, requiring a lot of computation. Numerical methods for computing the second derivative also require a lot of computation -- if *N* values are required to compute the first derivative, $N^2$ are required for the second derivative (source: [stack exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/253632/why-is-newtons-method-not-widely-used-in-machine-learning)).

Finally, another method is the [**coordinate descent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent) that iterates over individual coordinates (keeping others fixed), in order to minimize the loss function.

</p>

The main advantage is that it is extremely simple to implement and doesn’t require any knowledge of the derivative of the function. It’s really useful for extremely complicated functions or functions whose derivatives are far more expensive to compute than the function itself. However, due to its iterative nature, it's not a good candidate for parallelism. Another issue is that it has a a non-smooth multivariable function, thus it may be stuck in non-stationary point if the level curves of a function are not smooth (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent#Limitations)).

## Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting is fitting the noise in addition to the signal. Underfitting is not fitting the signal well. To reduce overfitting, increasing data *may help*.

</p>

We can also use regularization, forcing the model to be not too complex.

## Regularization

Occam’s Razor: "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity" or *simple models are better. To simplify the model, we can add a regulatization term $\Omega$ to penalize complex models:

$$
min_w L(w) + \Omega (w)
$$

Techniques:
- L2 regularization (standard Euclidean norm): $$ \Omega(w) = \lambda \| w \|^2 $$, where $$ \| w \|^2 = \sum_{i=0}^M w_i^2 $$
  - Large weights will be penalized, as they are *considered unlikely*;
  - If $L$ is the MSE, this is called **Ridge Regression** ;
  - the parameter $ \lambda \gt 0 $ can be tuned to reduce overfitting. This is the **model selection** problem;
  - similarly to the Least Squares problem, the loss of the MSE with Rigde Regression has an analytical solution:
    - computed by minimizing $(y - Xw)^T(y-Wx) + \lambda w^Tw$, and;
    - derivating with respect to $w$ leads to the normal equation $w = (X^TX - \lambda I)^{-1} X^Ty$.
- L1 regularization: $$ \Omega(w) = \lambda \| w \| $$, where $$
 \| w \| = \sum_{i=0}^M | w_i | $$ 
  - keeping L1-norm small forces some elements in $w$ to be strictly 0, thus enforcity sparcity. Some features will not be used since their weight is 0.
  - If $L$ is the MSE, this is called **Lasso Regression**;
- [shrinkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkage_estimator); 
- [dropout](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5): a method to *drop out* (ignore) neurons in a (deep) [neural network]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-27-Deep-Neural-Networks %}) and retrieving the final model as an average of models (see separate [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-27-Deep-Neural-Networks %}) in Deep Neural Networks for details.

As a final note, Linear models can be made more powerful, by constructing better features for your input data. One way is to use nonlinear **

A good application of a kernal is to *help* our regression model by adapting the input space to the mode. An example is 

## Matrix Factorization

Matrix factorization can be used to discover underling latent factors and/or to predict missing values of the matrix. We aim to find $W$, $Z$ such that $$ W \approx WZ^T $$. I.e. we aim to predict $x_{dn}$, where $d$ is an element in $Z$, and $n$ is an element in $W$. For movie rating, $Z$ could be users, $W$ could be movies, and $x_{dn}$ the star rating.

We aim at optimizing:

$$
min_{W,Z} L (W,Z) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(d,n) \in \Omega} [ x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2
$$

where $$ D \in R^{D \times K} $$ and $$ Z \in R^{N \times K} $$ are tall matrices, and $$ \Omega \subseteq [D] \times [N] $$ collects the indices of the observed ratings of the input matrix $X$.

<p align="center">
<img width="60%"  src="/assets/Supervised-Learning/matrix-factorization.png">
</p>

This cost function is not convex and not [identifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiability). $K$ is the number of latent features (e.g. gender, age group, citizenship, etc). Large $K$ facilitates overfitting. We can add a regularizer to the function:

$$
min_{W,Z} L (W,Z) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(d,n) \in \Omega} [ x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2 + \frac{\lambda_w}{2} \| W \|^2 +  \frac{\lambda_z}{2} \| Z \|^2
$$ 

where (again), $\lambda_z$ and  $\lambda_w$ are scalars. 

We use stochastic gradient descent to optimize this problem. The training objective is a function over \|$\Omega$\| terms (one per rating):

$$
\frac{1}{| \Omega |} \sum_{(d,n) \in \Omega} \frac{1}{2} [x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2
$$

For one fixed element $(d,n)$, we derive the gradient $(d',k)$ for $W$ and  $(n',k)$ for $Z$:

$$
(d',k) = \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{d',k}} \frac{1}{2} [x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2 =
\begin{cases}
    -[x_n - (WZ^T)_{dn}] z_{n,k} & \text{, if } d'=d\\
    0,              & \text{, otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
(n',k) = \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{n',k}} \frac{1}{2} [x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2 =
\begin{cases}
    -[x_n - (WZ^T)_{dn}] w_{d,k} & \text{, if } n'=n\\
    0,              & \text{, otherwise}
\end{cases} 
$$

Reminder: $z_{n,k}$ are user features, $w_{d,k}$ are movie features. The gradient has $(D+N)K$ entries.

We can also use **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**. The ALS factorizes a given matrix $R$ into two factors $U$ and $V$ such that $$ R \approx U^TV $$.

- If there are **no** missing ratings in the matrix ie $$ \Omega = [D] \times [N] $$, then:

  $$
  min_{W,Z} L(W,Z) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{d=1}^D \sum_{n=1}^N [x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2 + \text{ (regularizer) } =  \frac{1}{2} \| X - WZ^T \| ^2 + \frac{\lambda_w}{2} \| W \|^2 +  \frac{\lambda_z}{2} \| Z \|^2
  $$

  - We can use coordinate descent (minimize $W$ for fixed $Z$ and vice-versa) to minimize cost plus regularizer;
- If there are missing entries, the problem is harder, as only the ratings $$ (d,n) \in \Omega $$ contribute to the cost, i.e..;

  $$
  min_{W,Z} L(W,Z) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(d,n) \in \Omega} [x_{dn} - (WZ^T)_{dn}]^2 + ...
  $$

## Text Embedding

All learning methods require some kind of numerical representation of the input space. Booleans are converted to 0 or 1s, labelling of input samples according to different sets is represented by fixed-size weighted input vector (or binning, where each position of the vector represents the weight of a sample on each class), etc. On textual representations, where inputs have different lenghts, the solution relies on **embedding** our textual representation into a fixed-size numerical vector space, and use the new vector and input and output of our model. For the curious ones, here are some embedding techniques:
- [Bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model). Each word is represented by an index in a vocabulary of words.
- The Co-occurence Matrix, where $n_{ij}$ holds contexts where word $i$ is used along word $j$;
  - We can use the previous method of matrix factorization to predict words co-occurence;
- [word2vec](https://skymind.ai/wiki/word2vec): word is represented by the hidden layer of a trained 2-layer neural network;
  - Very good explanation [here](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/);
- [GLOVE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/): similar as Word2Vec. While Word2Vec is a *predictive* model that predicts context given word, GLOVE learns by constructing a co-occurrence matrix (words $\times$ context) that counts how frequently a word appears in a context. Since it's going to be a gigantic matrix, we factorize this matrix to achieve a lower-dimension representation.
  - Another good resource [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/emnlp-what-is-glove-part-i-3b6ce6a7f970);
- Skip-Gram model: we train a neural network with pairs of words. We the utilized the network to retrieve the probability of every word in the dictionary to appear near the input word;
  - Another good resource [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-skip-gram-model-part-1-intuition-78614e4d6e0b)
- [FastText (from facebook)](https://fasttext.cc/): Still need to get a grasp on this one!

## Binning

We have seen that simple linear classification schemes like logistic regression can work well but are limited. For some data representations that are non-linear, some classifiers (e.g. polynomial) may still be good, particularly when we know a priori which features are useful. A possible solution is to add as many features as possible i.e. add all polynomial terms up to some order, leading to overfitting.

Another possibility is to use **binning**, a technique for data preparation where we represent input as combinations of input data intervals, allowing a non-linear combination of inputs. As a simple example, take a neural network to detect the house prices inSwitzerland for a given latitude and longitude. A regular neural net would be trained for a given *latitude* and *longitude* input, against an output price. This could only represent linear combinations of both parameters. Alternatively we can discretize the parameters space, and represent as input all the combinations of latitude and longitude intervals, allowing non-linearity in the model:

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="/assets/Supervised-Learning/binning.png"><br/>
</p>

This approach obviously falls short for high input dimensionality. For such use cases, deep neural networks is the solution, as it provides a non-linear approximator.
