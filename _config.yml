# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a PhD Neuroscience candidate at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.  I create large scale computer algorithms to map and simulate the neural networks in the brain. My fields of specialization are Parallel and Distributed Computing, Simulation, Machine Learning and Data Science. Prior to this, I graduated with a MSc Advanced Computing from the Imperial College London, with distinction for my research project, and I worked in London, Sao Paulo, New York and Slovenia. I like to ski, read, travel, and play waterpolo. If you'd like to learn more about me you can read my <a href="cv_short.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=pirWLLgAAAAJ">publications</a>, or send me an <a href="mailto:bruno@magalhaes.pro?subject=Hello">email</a>.
