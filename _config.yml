  I'm an AI resident at Microsoft Research in Cambridge (UK) working on time-sequence data and probabilistic machine learning. Prior to this, I finished a PhD Neuroscience at the EPFL in Switzerland (researching large-scale computer algorithms to map and simulate brain-inspired neural networks), a MSc Advanced Computing from the Imperial College London, and I worked in Lausanne, London, Sao Paulo and New York. My fields of specialization are Parallel and Distributed Computing, Machine Learning and Simulation.
