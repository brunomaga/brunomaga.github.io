description: >-
  I'm a PhD Neuroscience candidate at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. I research large scale computer algorithms to map and simulate neural networks in the brain. My fields of specialization are Parallel and Distributed Computing, Simulation and Machine Learning. Prior to this, I graduated with a MSc Advanced Computing from the Imperial College London, with distinction for my research project, and I worked in London, Sao Paulo, New York and Slovenia. I like to play waterpolo, travel and ski.
